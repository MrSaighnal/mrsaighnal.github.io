Hi I'm __MrSaighnal__ an Italian with a passion for IT and Cyber Security. I'm ($age>=20 && $age<=30) years old. I love pentesting, web, blockchain, and understanding how things work. This motivated me to study IT.
I also like pets, reading about space exploration, music, good movies and escape rooms.
